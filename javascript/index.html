The while loop runs until is true;4

1. determine, what kind of loop you want, based on how long you want the loop to run.

	1.1. For loop -> You can run the code the number of times you specifcy

	1.2.While loop -> You run the code until a condition is met.

	1.3. steps

	1.3.1. Enter the keyword, depending on the loop

	1.3.2. The first position is always 0. 

	1.3.3. It is necessary to create the variable, thus defining the starting point. define the end by x < (name of variable), input the x++ to indicate increment is increasing by 1. To increment by 2 is x+=2

	1.3.4. to run the loop backwards. establish the array length using .length property. then substract -1 ex. annoying_popup.length-1.
